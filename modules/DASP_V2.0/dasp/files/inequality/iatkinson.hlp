Users should set their surveys' sampling design before using this module 
(and then save their data files). If the sampling design is not set, simple-random sampling (SRS) will be automatically assigned 
by default. {cmd:iatkinson} estimates the following inequality indices and their standard errors {p_end}
{p 4 8}{inp:. Atkinson index}{p_end}


{title:Description} 
{p}{cmd:Inequality:} To estimate the Atkinson index 

{title:Options}

{p 0 4} {cmdab:hsize}   Household size. For example, to compute inequality at the invididual level, one will want to weight household-level observations by household size (in addition to sampling weights, best set in survey design). {p_end}

{p 0 4} {cmdab:hgroup}   Variable that captures a socio-demographic group. For example, this variable could equal 1 for rural households and 2 for urban ones. When this option is used, the associated varlist should contain only one variable. {p_end}

{p 0 4} {cmdab:epsilon}     The value of the parameter epsilon (see the users' manual for mor details). By default, this parameter is set to 0.5. {p_end}

{p 0 4} {cmdab:level}   To set the confidence level of the confidence interval to be produced. {p_end}

{p 0 4} {cmdab:conf}     To set the type of confidence interval desired: "ts" for two sided, "lb" for lower-bounded and "up" for upper-bounded.{p_end}

{p 0 4} {cmdab:dec}    To set the number of decimals used in the display of results. {p_end}

{title:Examples}

{p 4 8}{inp:. iatkinson income, hsize(size) }{p_end}

{p 4 8}{inp:. iatkinson income, hsize(size) epsilon(0.5) }{p_end}
